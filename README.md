# openpomodoro-hooks

Hooks I use with [open-pomodoro cli][cli]. It is mostly oriented toward a sway/i3 desktop environment and text based programs.

## Features

* silences notifications (do not disturb mode) with [mako][] and [dunst][].
* make [cmus][] play a song for the duration of the pomodoro (I use [mynoise sounds][mynoise])
